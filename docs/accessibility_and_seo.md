To ensure accessibility, I added ARIA labels to key elements, making the app screen reader-friendly. I implemented keyboard navigation with focus states for buttons and form fields. High-contrast colors were used to enhance readability for users with visual impairments. For SEO, I set proper meta tags and titles to improve search engine visibility.
