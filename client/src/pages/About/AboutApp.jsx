      <Paragraph>
        This app is primarily created for personal use, as I am a self-proclaimed <StrongText>coffee and tea enthusiast</StrongText>. I consume a considerable amount of caffeine each day, and sometimes, I find it difficult to engage in conversation before my first cup of coffee. üòÖ
      </Paragraph>
      
      <Paragraph>
        But I recently recognized the need to <BoldText>reduce my caffeine intake</BoldText> for health reasons. It‚Äôs one of those adulting moments, right? This led me to the idea of creating an application to track my caffeine consumption. üßê
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <BoldText>Fun fact:</BoldText> It‚Äôs generally recommended to limit caffeine intake to <HighlightText>400mg per day</HighlightText>‚Äîthe upper limit for most individuals. So, if you‚Äôre someone who drinks a lot of caffeine like me, perhaps it‚Äôs time to start monitoring your intake as well. 
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Since moving to Scandinavia, I‚Äôve adopted the local tradition of "<BoldText>fika</BoldText>", a delightful custom of taking a break with coffee and something sweet. As a result, my coffee consumption has only increased. If you're not familiar with it, fika is essentially a daily coffee ritual. Needless to say, I‚Äôm quite fond of it. ü•ê‚òï
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In addition to my love for coffee, ever since I started training at the gym & coding, as part of my new routine, energy drinks have also become a regular part of my lifestyle. They give me that extra boost when I need it, but I‚Äôm trying to keep track and stay mindful of how much caffeine I‚Äôm consuming from all sources.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        So, here I am, building this app to help track my caffeine intake‚Äîhopefully help me. And, if you‚Äôre in a similar situation, perhaps this app could be of use to you as well!
